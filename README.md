# Enzyme_prediction
# Enzyme Function Prediction through subsequence tokenization and ensemble learning framework
In Datasets folder contains all the test-dataset for enzyme function prediction in different hierarchy labels
Codes folder contains three files 
1. Feature.py: to extract subsequence based feature from any given protein sequence
2. model.py: train an ensemble classifier and predict the EC number for a given protein sequence
